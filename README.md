# Extra Space App

This is a simple Rails App I made to test some concepts and technologies I recently started using at work.

Software Used
Bootstrap-Sass for css
Paperclip/AWS used to upload and store file attachments to S3
Remotipart - non-complicated AJAX file uploads. Handles targeting an iframe for you
Turbolinks for navigation
